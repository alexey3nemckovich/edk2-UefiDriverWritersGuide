### 1.1.1 Assumptions

This document assumes that the reader is familiar with the following:

* Unified Extensible Firmware Interface Specification, Version 2.3.1.

* The EDK II is an open-source build environment project that is under constant
  development. EDK II not only provides the build environment, but also
  provides build tools and source code for firmware and drivers.

**********
**Note:** _The [EDK II project](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/EDK-II) of
[TianoCore](http://www.tianocore.org/) is under active
development, often on a daily basis. Be sure to use a validated release of
[UDK2010](https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/UDK2010) for all UEFI Driver development._
**********

* The _UDK2010 Developer's Kit_, referred to in this guide as the _UDK2010,_
  contains EDK II validated common-core sample code. The open-source UDK2010 is
  a stable build of the EDKII project and has been validated on a variety of
  Intel platforms, operating systems and application software. The open-source
  UDK2010 is available for download at www.tianocore.org

* The UDK2010 supports UEFI Driver development using the following operating
  system environments: Microsoft Windows*, UNIX and like systems and MAC OS
  X(R). Refer to [_http://www.tianocore.org_](http://www.tianocore.org/) for a
  complete list of current development operating systems.

* The UDK2010 supports the development of UEFI Drivers using several families
  of compilers including those from Microsoft*, Intel and GCC. Refer to
  [_http://www.tianocore.org_](http://www.tianocore.org/) for a complete list
  of currently supported compilers.
